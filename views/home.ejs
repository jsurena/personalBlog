                        Do you remember your very first dream job? A lot of people I’ve asked have said various things: actor, lawyer, dancer, singer, superhero, storm chaser, etc. 
                        I think I’m the only person I know who has ever said “architect” to that question. During my time in Haiti, I lived with my grandmother in the house that
                        I was once told my deceased grandfather had built (I came to find out that the house was my grandmother’s vision, not his) and I was so impressed by this that...</p>

                        My name is Jean-Sebastien Surena, but you can call me Jean. I am a Computer Information Systems major at Baruch College in New York City. 
                        Although I’m a CIS major on paper, I’m a Comp Sci student at heart. I’m entering my senior year and currently on the Cybersecurity track, my minor is Theater.
